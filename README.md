# parsha_gematria

This uses the [Hebrew](https://pypi.org/project/hebrew/) library. See the [repo here](https://github.com/avi-perl/hebrew). Major kudos goes to [TorahCalc](https://www.torahcalc.com/gematria/) whose calculator and explanations were critical to the development of this feature.

The spelling of the  parsha names are debatable. All feedback is welcome.
